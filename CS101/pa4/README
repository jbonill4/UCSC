//	SOME PARTS OF MY GRAPH.C WORK.
//	I TRIED PLAYING AROUND WITH IT TOO
//	MUCH AND NOW IT HAS TOO MANY ERRORS 
//	TO EVEN COMPILE AND IS TOO CLOSE TO THE DEADLINE
//	FOR ME TO FIX. It is missing a print 
//	function on top of that. I am apologizing ahead of time
//	to whoever has to grade this. Thank you 
//	for your time.
