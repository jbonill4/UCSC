                at least it reminds me of my feeling towards it, for I know latin). So now you
                need two languages to get one thing accomplished! And the whole thing is so

            <p style="line-height:1.2"><font size="5"> A new, very efficient algorithm enables fast scene rendering<br><br></font></p>
            <p> <font size="4">
                <i>Ray-tracing</i> is a technique for scene rendering in which the 
                light rays that fall into an observer's eyes are retraced, 
                so to say, in the reverse direction, to reconstruct exactly 
                what the view would have been. This is a daunting process, 
                because when encoutering solid bodies, light is scattered, and 
                so the ray tracing must chase the many possible backwards paths 
                of such scattering. Professor de Alfaro recently claimed to have 
                invented a new, far more efficient algorithm, one that works in 
                microseconds regardless of the dimension or complexity of the scene. 
                <i>"There are a few restrictions,"</i> he added, <i>"and for the moment our new 
                technique is applicable only to closed environments in which the integral 
                of the luminous flux is zero across any closed surface."</i> The contribution is 
                currently undergoing peer review.</font></p>
